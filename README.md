This is a full-stack e-commerce website. You can browse through the products available on the website and add them to your shopping cart. Additionally, you have the option to adjust the quantity of the products you wish to order. Once you're ready to make a purchase, simply proceed to checkout, and the website will redirect you to the payment page powered by Stripe.

I use Next.js as the framework and TypeScript as the programming language for developing the applications. For styling, I utilize Tailwind CSS and integrate Lucide Icons to enhance the visual appeal of the website. Additionally, I incorporate Sanity to dynamically fetch data for the website. For authentication, I rely on Kinde. I utilize Vercel Postgres Database to store client data and communicate with the database through Drizzle ORM (Object Relational Mapping). To ensure data integrity, I implement Zod for type safety. Finally, for seamless payment processing and checkout, I integrate Stripe.
